# Automate Installation of WordPress
An automation for WordPress installations and configurations that created with Vagrant.

## What it does?
Goal is to install WordPress with all its dependencies. 

## How does it work?
You can use ```vagrant_up``` script for initiating process, because it is used for starting the ```vagrant up``` process smoothly.
Similarly, ```vagrant_down``` script can be used for teardown (destroy, halt and suspend) process. 
All other files are responsible for Vagrant VM's configuration and WordPress installation-configuration phases.
